ROCgdb documentation
======================

This is the documentation for AMD ROCm Debugger (ROCgdb) for Linux, which is the AMD source-level debugger based on the `GNU Debugger (GDB) <https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/>`_. For documentation on ROCgdb for Windows, see `AMD ROCm debugger for Windows <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-windows/en/latest/how-to/debugger-windows.html>`_. ROCgdb enables heterogeneous debugging on the ROCm software that consists of an x86-based host architecture along with
commercially available AMD GPU architectures supported by the :doc:`AMD Debugger API
Library (ROCdbgapi) <rocdbgapi:index>`. ROCdbgapi is included with ROCm.

ROCgdb provides the following features:

- Debugs ROCm applications running on AMD GPU-supported hardware.
- Debugs applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.
- Offers a seamless debugging environment that allows simultaneous GPU and CPU code debugging within the same application, just like programming in :doc:`HIP <hip:index>`, which is a seamless extension of C++ programming.
- Additional features to support debugging ROCm device code on top of the existing GDB debugging features, which are inherently present for debugging the host code.
- Supports :doc:`HIP <hip:index>` kernel debugging.
- Allows you to set breakpoints, single-step ROCm applications, and inspect and modify the memory and variables of any given thread running on the hardware.

The code is open source and hosted at: https://github.com/ROCm/ROCgdb
